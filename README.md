## Upload the sketch

When you try to upload a new sketch to your ESP32 and it fails to connect to your board, it means that your ESP32 is not in flashing/uploading mode. Having the right board name and COM por selected, follow these steps:

- Hold-down the “BOOT” button in your ESP32 board
- Press the “Upload” button in the Arduino IDE to upload a new sketch
- After you see the  “Connecting….” message in your Arduino IDE, release the finger from the “BOOT” button
